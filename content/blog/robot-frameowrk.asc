== Overview

Testing is a part of product life cycle. I wonder is there any tool or
programing language which will be fun to work with except
python. Since python is grown in such a way that even a non programmer
become a programmer. In case of testing team, traditionaly there is a
image that they won't code. But python fills the gap between coding
and testing.

Still many people doesn't know the power of Python and Robotframe work
in testing field.

The main objective of this article is to give an Example of an
Embedded system and how that can be tested using python and robotframe
work.

Actually I am rewriting this article which I posted in stack overflow
documentation (How robot framework is used in Automation testing in
Embedded Systems?). Since documentation beta is closed by Stack
Overflow.

I am writing this article because I like to make testing team to have
a taste of coding.

== Requirements to build the RPS

Requirements for building a remote power supply are

    Remote power supply should be able to turn ON/OFF remotely
    Remote power supply status can be accessed remotely.



== Remote Power supply simulation

Since we don't have a real remote power supply hardware, we are going
to simulate it using python program.

=== Basic idea about RPS

* Actually remote power supply has a http server.
* User can send commands to turn ON/OFF power supply using http request.

We are going to simulate remote power supply using following program
rps-server.py.

[source, python]
----
include::./../../src/rps-server.py[]
----

=== How to run rps server ?

----
$ export FLASK_APP=rps-server.py
$ flask run
----

=== How to send commands to rps server ?


Following are the two commands used to control the RPS

----
    1. SetPower
    2. GetPower
----

By default the server will be listening at the port 5000.

The power supply ports are,

----
    P60
    P61
    P62
    P64
----

The states of the ports are,

----
    ON - 1
    OFF - 0
----

== Deriving test cases

Now the RPS server is ready for simulation.
We need to write test case to test RPS system.

=== Test cases derived from requirement

    Turn on Power supply 2 remotely.
    Verify power supply 2 is on.
    Turn off Power supply 2 remotely.
    Verify power supply 2 is off.

=== Manual Testing

    * Run the rps server.
    * To turn on Port 3, open a browser and give following URI

----
http://admin:12345678@localhost:5000/SetCmd?CMD=SetPower&P62=1
----
    * To get the status of all the ports

----
http://admin:12345678@localhost:5000/SetCmd?CMD=GetPower
----

== Writing test library

We need to write a test library in python for sending http commands using http request. Later we will be using this library as keywords in robot frame work.
commands.py

We are going to use library from commands.py to send SetPower and GetPower.
