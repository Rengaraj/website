## Overview

Testing is a part of product life cycle. I wonder is there any tool or programing language which will be fun to work with except python. Since python is
grown in such a way that even a non programmer become a programmer. In case of testing team, traditionaly there is a image that they won't code. But python fills the gap between coding and testing.

Still many people doesn't know the power of Python and Robotframe work in testing field.

The main objective of this article is to give an Example of an Embedded system and how that can be tested using python and robotframe work.

Actually I am rewriting this article which I posted in stack overflow documentation 
(How robot framework is used in Automation testing in Embedded Systems?). Since documentation beta is closed by Stack Overflow.

I am writing this article because I like to make testing team to have a taste of coding.
